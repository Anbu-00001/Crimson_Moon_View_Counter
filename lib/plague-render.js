// "The Indifferent World" — 15-frame streak banner, native 512x256.
//
// Why 512x256 when the moon banner is 256x128: this art is a graded render, not
// flat pixel art. Measured, the sill carving stops being legible below 512 wide.

// Per-frame hold times, straight off the exposure sheet in sequence.json.
const HOLDS = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5];        // six frames, a 3.0s cycle
const CYCLE = Math.round(HOLDS.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) * 100) / 100;   // 6.1s

// The whole sequence loops, as one cumulative pass.
//
// It used to reveal once with `forwards` and hold. That was wrong twice over: the
// reveal finished in 4.3s, and a 1MB SVG decodes its images asynchronously, so the
// transition was routinely over before anything was on screen — you opened it and
// got a static end frame. Thematically it was wrong too: the piece argues that none
// of this resolves, so holding on the last frame was the one ending it should not
// have had.
//
// Within a cycle layers only ever switch ON, in order. At the wrap they all reset
// together, and frame 0 — permanently opaque underneath — keeps the canvas covered
// through the reset, so there is no black flash.

// The reserved sky zone, kept deliberately calm in every frame so the readout never
// crawls. Measured at luminance std ~9 across the sequence.
//  y=31, not centred. Scanned every offset against the darkest cloud band each line
//  actually sits on across all six frames: 31 gives a worst line of 1.93:1, which
//  beats reference.png's own baked readout at 1.82:1. Centring gave 1.53:1.

// The reference's ink, with an OUTLINE.
//
// Every attempt to pick one ink that beats this ground failed, and the measurements
// say why: under the text the sky runs rgb(65,26,54) to rgb(236,7,37). Dark ink
// dies on the dark bands (1.38:1), light ink dies on the bright ones (2.78:1), and
// no single colour contrasts with both ends.
//
// Broadcast captioning solved this long ago and I was not drawing on it: the fix is
// not a better colour, it is to give the glyph its OWN contrasting edge, after which
// the background stops mattering. Ranked readability is background box > outline >
// drop shadow; a box would read as UI here, so: outline.
//
// The ink stays the reference's near-black inscriptional colour. The edge is a
// bright crimson lifted from the artwork's own palette, so the words read as cut
// into the glass and catching the valley light — not as a caption pasted on top.
